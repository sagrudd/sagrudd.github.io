One of the highlights of my academic career was a simple comparative genomics
platform called initially `Sputnik` and later `openSputnik`. The software
was used to massage a collection of Sanger-based cDNA sequences through a
computational pipeline to prepare `unigenes` and to annotate these unigenes for
the preparation of summary statistics, reports and to facilitate `comparative
genomics` in the absence of a complete genome sequence.

The `openSputnik` software died when I moved into the pharmaceutical industry
in 2006 when I was actively discouraged from continuing my academic pursuits. I
am not aware of copies of the software being available anywhere - it would
I suspect be rather embarrassing to see the code that was hacked together to
facilitate publications rather than support...
