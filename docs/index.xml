      <description>TL;DR - I&amp;rsquo;m in Brexile - forced to remain in Germany with family because the alternatives are far too complicated.
 New Year 2021. Yay! 2020 was a massive dog&amp;rsquo;s breakfast of a year. 2021 starts with the completely unnecessary bullshit that is Brexit.
The Macmillan dictionary helpfully defines a new word to classify my existence; one of Brexile. This definition does not really explain very much about the choices that have had to be made - I have been forcibly brexiled by the English government.</description>
