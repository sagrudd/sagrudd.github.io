<p>Yesterday’s first excursion into the <code>blogdown</code> universe helped prepare some
basic content with the default <em><code>hugo-lithium</code></em> theme. I read the wonderful
post by <a href="https://amber.rbind.io/2016/12/19/website/#adding-a-blog-post-or-portfolio-piece">Amber Thomas</a>
and although perhaps a little dated it contained a couple of technical gems that
are super-relevant to getting an R-based blog presented via <code>github</code> using
<code>blogdown</code>.</p>
<p>What has actually changed?</p>
<pre><code>blogdown::install_theme(
    &quot;kishaningithub/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme&quot;,
    theme_example = TRUE,
    update_config = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>This trivial command changes the <em>hugo</em> theme. A few files are downloaded - some
paths become stale so a little bit of moving of things around … and we have
something that looks a whole lot more attractive!</p>
<p>The advantage that this new <code>creative-portfolio</code> theme brings is the ability to
tag <em>portfolio</em> posts with images. This works for both the <em>portfolio</em> and
<em>blog</em> posts - there is an ability to <code>showonlyimage:</code> and to control the
amount of the post that is displayed with the <code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code> tag – awesomeness.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that everything is perfect - but we are certainly a step
closer to where I would like things to be!</p>
