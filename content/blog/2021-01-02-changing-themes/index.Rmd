Yesterday's first excursion into the `blogdown` universe helped prepare some
basic content with the default *`hugo-lithium`* theme. I read the wonderful
post by [Amber Thomas](https://amber.rbind.io/2016/12/19/website/#adding-a-blog-post-or-portfolio-piece) 
and although perhaps a little dated it contained a couple of technical gems that
are super-relevant to getting an R-based blog presented via `github` using
`blogdown`.


What has actually changed?

```
blogdown::install_theme(
    "kishaningithub/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme",
    theme_example = TRUE,
    update_config = TRUE)
```

This trivial command changes the *hugo* theme. A few files are downloaded - some
paths become stale so a little bit of moving of things around ... and we have
something that looks a whole lot more attractive!

The advantage that this new `creative-portfolio` theme brings is the ability to
tag *portfolio* posts with images.
