We are a week further into this year since the last post - so much for the
ambitions of a post a day! A load of things have happened, a week back at work
with the accompanying excitement, progress and planning for the next rounds of
awesomeness. We have committed to becoming the owners of a puppy (we'll have a
post on that once she has taken up residence ...).

For today's words we will have a quick look at `shucking disks`. Using 
[Amazon.de](https://amazon.de) as a guide, hard-disks can be purchased simply.
I have some projects to introduce in the coming weeks where we will require a
reasonable amount of not extraordinarily fast storage. My existing 
[freenas](https://freenas.org) and [unRAID](https://unraid.net) servers don't
have a lot of space. My aged Synology RS-816 is looking after backup for my
various laptops - it's time to upgrade its disks!

I would like to go with 6Tb disks - it's a compromise between space and price -
6Tb disks are about 100 EUR each so relatively affordable. 

The funny thing is that an external disk in an enclosure with power-supply and
USB cable costs **100 EUR**. A hard disk without the consumer packaging, plastic
enclosure and power supply costs between 130 and 150 EUR and a NAS approved disk
(again without any extra consumer waste) costs 175 EUR. Normally I'd just go 
with NAS approved disks - but I'm looking to live dangerously and hope to 
acquire a modest following of bioinformaticians who can shudder at these
foolish thoughts.
