Post number two! Exciting!

There has been a selection pressure to do stuff in `Python`. Python is the
corporate language of choice; everyone else uses Python. Python even makes
cups of tea. Using R is a heresy.

I have started re-invigorating some of my earlier R-projects that have since
been migrated into Python. During the strange COVID-esque end-of-2020 this has 
been a source of pleasure. I had the desire to learn some of the 
[**Tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) tricks and tools - it's wonderful! 
The project that was formerly called 
[**`nanopoRe`**](https://github.com/sagrudd/nanopoRe) is currently being
reinvented as [**`floundeR`**](https://github.com/sagrudd/floundeR) and I am 
again finding that R is a pleasure.

The webpages at [**sagrudd.github.io**](https://sagrudd.github.io) have been 
around for ages but never quite conquered. This Christmas break has been great 
for playing with some of the tools that I had been waiting to explore. I am not
disappointed. This whole website is produced using the R `blogdown` package;
the template is vanilla - I'll change this later but it's rather easy to play
with this vanity project.

I intend to use these pages to share some thoughts and tricks ... I'm getting
started!
