One of the highlights of my academic career was a simple comparative genomics
platform called initially `Sputnik` and later `openSputnik`. The software
was used to massage a collection of Sanger-based cDNA sequences through a
computational pipeline to prepare `unigenes` and to annotate these unigenes for
the preparation of summary statistics, reports and to facilitate `comparative
genomics` in the absence of a complete genome sequence.

The `openSputnik` software died when I moved into the pharmaceutical industry
in 2006 when I was actively discouraged from continuing my academic pursuits. I
am not aware of copies of the software being available anywhere - it would
I suspect be rather embarrassing to see the code that was hacked together to
facilitate publications rather than support...

In the desire to be a little more active in my coding ambitions I have made the
decision to bring the project back to life but from a third-generation DNA
sequencing perspective. A quick survey of bioinformatics publications shows that
there is an abundance of quality workflow software for cDNA sequence analysis
but most are for quantitative analysis. I see a gap in the bioinformatics
universe where something akin to the earlier openSputnik concept could live;
not reinventing wheels but now further building on the technologies such as
NextFlow (or Snakemake). As a vehement advocate of `R` - we'll do the data
science coding in R where possible.  

I have created a GitHub project for the new 
[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 Unit 2](https://github.com/sagrudd/gwangmyeongseong3) project.
I am not working to any timelines - just a background exercise to keep me
engaged through this current COVID-lockdown. Please, watch this space!

I love the `lodestar` name for the satellite.**
