TL;DR - I'm in `Brexile` - forced to remain in Germany with family because the
alternatives are far too complicated.

New Year 2021. Yay! 2020 was a massive dog's breakfast of a year. 2021 starts
with the completely unnecessary bullshit that is `Brexit`. 

<!--more-->

The [Macmillan dictionary](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/brexile) 
helpfully defines a new word to classify my existence; one of `Brexile`. This
definition does not really explain very much about the choices that have had to
be made - I have been forcibly brexiled by the English government.

So who am I to comment on any of this?

* I am, at the time of writing, a 46 year old Englishman. I was born with the
great privilege of a *conservative* family that enabled attendance of a fabulous 
(public) school and the opportunity to study a course that interested me at my
preferred university.
* My wife of 21 years, Antje, was an Erasmus exchange student at the University
of Nottingham. After her return to Germany we maintained a long distance
relationship and she moved to Norwich when we were both PhD students - no need
for paperwork, visas or other hurdles.
* I did my postdoctoral research at a Max Planck Institute (and at what was then
the GSF Neuherberg) in Munich - moving to a different country was simple,
exciting and encouraged.
* After 4 years of postdoctoral bliss (and a couple of children) we moved to
Turku in Finland so that I could start my own research group - my English
qualifications were recognised without issue or barrier). We stayed in Turku
for several years before starting a brief world tour (Malaysia, Australia and
Singapore) - I can comment on the exhausting requirements to get professional
documents translated and recognised for work-permits and visas.
* We have been back in Germany for a few years now - Antje is a high-school
teacher at a local `Gymnasium` and our 4 children study at local universities
and schools. If I leave Germany now (footnotes) I do not have an automatic right
to return to my home or family!
* I had always imagined returning to the UK. With a European wife and children,
(again see footnotes) it is no longer just a case of finding a job, somewhere
to live and a couple of shipping containers.

`Brexile` for me is being corralled into Germany. I am no longer free to e.g. 
just move back to Finland with the expectation that I can return home. I can
move but this will now involve a more onerous and technical process. I can
probably move back - but `what if?`

`Brexit` has been a horribly devisive subject. My own parents are amongst the
corrupted who feel that the UK's separation from Europe will improve their
existence. I am pained that `Fernweh` now requires serious consideration and
that I have to now commit to a less ephemeral existence. 

### Footnotes

1.  Yes, I can of course leave Germany for a holiday, a trip to the UK or just
because. I have `wanderlust` - I now cannot just move to New York or Shanghai
for a couple of years - no one knows quite how much time we can spend away ...
2.  Yes, I can of course become German. Is that the right thing to do though?
British politicians are quite happy to acquire multiple citizenships; I don't
feel German - I am European. If I become German then I am no longer British and
opportunities to relocate back to the UK become a whole lot more complicated.
3.  Yes, my children could become British - they laughed at me the last time
I asked if they would like to have citizenship. We occupy a thin slice of
privilege here in the German Harz region; the UK is not an attractive option
for all!
