In the previous post I introduced a quick exploration into the theme identified
as `hugo-creative-portfolio-theme`. This added some figures and some great new
understanding as to how `hugo` works - I have now gone one step further and have
again a new favourite `hugo` theme. The canonical theme can be 
[browsed here](https://themes.gohugo.io/liva-hugo/) - installing into `blogdown`
is as simple as ... (yes - I started with a clean install to vanish some of the
fluff from the last couple of days).

```
blogdown::new_site(theme="gethugothemes/liva-hugo")
```

I repopulated the couple of posts prepared yesterday and we have shuffled around
the location for the figures that have been included. Some modification of the
`html` code included in the theme has been performed to sharpen the pages and to
make them a little more to my liking.

One of the major differences for the `liva-hugo` theme is that in addition to
the 'normal' blog posts there is a concept of `type: "featured"` so that some
posts can be pinned to the landing page - w00t! This feature will require a bit
of moderation but is useful for highlighting some of the more salient content.
I am also feeling that the concept of post categorisation is going to be super-
useful over the coming posts!

For these webpages I chose the useful 
[sagrudd.github.io](https://sagrudd.github.io) URL. This is hosted as a `GitHub
Pages` site - this provides rather limited opportunities in how the site code
and the presentation content are separated

In [Amber Thomas](https://amber.rbind.io/2016/12/19/website/#adding-a-blog-post-or-portfolio-piece)
post, she introduces a solution where the code side of the webpage is placed in
one GitHub branch (canonically called `hugo`) whilst the content rendered by the
*hugo* software is stored in the `master` branch. The `master` and `hugo`
branches are then linked using `git subtree` functionality. This seems
sufficient for my purposes ...

Amber introduces a couple of trivial scripts to shepherd the data in the right
directions; her examples were a couple of years old and not quite contemporary -
I have taken the liberty to update the code to work for me.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This script allows you to easily and quickly generate and deploy your website
# using Hugo to your personal GitHub Pages repository. This script requires a
# certain configuration, run the `setup.sh` script to configure this. See
# https://hjdskes.github.io/blog/deploying-hugo-on-personal-github-pages/index.html
# for more information.
# Set the English locale for the `date` command.
export LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8
# GitHub username.
USERNAME=sagrudd
# Name of the branch containing the Hugo source files.
SOURCE=hugo
# The commit message.
MESSAGE="Site rebuild $(date)"
msg() {
    printf "\033[1;32m :: %s\n\033[0m" "$1"
}
msg "Pulling down the \`master\` branch into \`public\` to help avoid merge conflicts"
git subtree pull --prefix public https://github.com/$USERNAME/$USERNAME.github.io.git master -m "Merge origin master"
msg "Building the website"
hugo
sleep 5s
msg "Pushing the updated \`public\` folder to the \`$SOURCE\` branch"
git add public
git commit -m "$MESSAGE"
git push
msg "Pushing the updated \`public\` folder to the \`master\` branch"
git subtree push --prefix public https://github.com/$USERNAME/$USERNAME.github.io.git master
```

It's a bit of a hack, but if you are reading this post - it seems to work!
