<p>One of the highlights of my academic career was a simple comparative genomics
platform called initially <code>Sputnik</code> and later <code>openSputnik</code>. The software
was used to massage a collection of Sanger-based cDNA sequences through a
computational pipeline to prepare <code>unigenes</code> and to annotate these unigenes for
the preparation of summary statistics, reports and to facilitate <code>comparative genomics</code> in the absence of a complete genome sequence.</p>
<p>The <code>openSputnik</code> software died when I moved into the pharmaceutical industry
in 2006 when I was actively discouraged from continuing my academic pursuits. I
am not aware of copies of the software being available anywhere - it would
I suspect be rather embarrassing to see the code that was hacked together to
facilitate publications rather than supportâ€¦</p>
